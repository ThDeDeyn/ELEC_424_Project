/* 
  This code has been used as a base for the project "Smart Wound Care : Device Design" included in the course "ELEC-H424 : Active Medical Device"

  This code is based on the example provided by te SparkFun library by Nathan Seidle (https://github.com/sparkfun/MAX30105_Breakout)
  The modifications made allow it to  measure the force applied on the FSR402 sensors and the temperature through the MAXREF. 


  Hardware Connections for the O2 Sensor (to Arduino Nano 33 BLE):
  -VIN= 3.3V
  -GND = GND
  -SDA = A4 (= SDA)
  -SCL = A5 (= SCL)
  -INT = Not connected

  It is recommended to attach the sensor to the finger for accurate measurement. The sensor is sensible to small movement and/or small modification in the pressure
  applied on it.
