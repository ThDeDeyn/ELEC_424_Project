AMD_VID_HR : This video shows the heart rate measured by the MAXREF spO2 sensor. 

AMD_VID_T : This video shows the temperature increasing up to 31Â°C when a finger is placed on the sensor. 
            At the end of the video, the finger is removed from the sensor and the temperature starts decreasing
            
AMD_VID_pressure : This video shows the pressure change when a finger is touching the sensor. First by rapidly touching it,
                   then by gradually increasing the pressure.
                   
AMD_VID_spO2 : This video shows the spO2 measured on a finger. The sensor is very sensitive to the pressure applied and shows some 
               incorrect values ( -999 ).
