This code has been used as a base for the project "Smart Wound Care : Device Design" included in the course "ELEC-H424 : Active Medical Device"

  This code is based on the example provided by te SparkFun library by Nathan Seidle (https://github.com/sparkfun/MAX30105_Breakout)
  The modifications made allow it to  measure the force applied on the FSR402 sensors. 

Hardware Connections for the O2 Sensor (to Arduino Nano 33 BLE):
  -VIN= 3.3V
  -GND = GND
  -SDA = A4 (= SDA)
  -SCL = A5 (= SCL)
  -INT = Not connected

  It is recommended to attach the sensor to the finger for accurate measurement. The sensor is sensible to small movement and/or small modification in the pressure
  applied on it. 

Hardware Connections for the pressure sensor (to Arduino Nano 33 BLE)
  -VCC = 3.3V
  -GND = GND
  -NC = Not connected 
  -OUT = A1
